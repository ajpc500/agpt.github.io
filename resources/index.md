# Getting Started

You can download all the repositories used in the book from the Guide to Purple Teaming GitHub organization [here](https://github.com/aguidetopurpleteaming).


For quick installation, the following one-liners can be used to download all repositories to the current directory. 

For Unix:

```sh
curl -s https://aguidetopurpleteaming.com/resources/get_repos.sh | sh
```

And for Windows using PowerShell:

```powershell
IWR https://aguidetopurpleteaming.com/resources/get_repos.ps1 | IEX
```

Make sure you've added the appropriate AV exclusions to prevent tool downloads being quarantined. 
{: #avexclusion .alert .alert-warning .p-3 .mx-2 mb-3}
